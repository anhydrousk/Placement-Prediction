This project predicts student placement using Logistic Regression based on two key factors: IQ and CGPA. The model learns patterns from past student data and classifies whether a student is likely to be placed (1) or not placed (0). Logistic Regression is used because it is simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification problems. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
